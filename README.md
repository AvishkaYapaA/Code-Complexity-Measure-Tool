# Code-Complexity-Measure-Tool
—In the Software Development industry, there are a huge number of the code and programming are being planned and actualized in a day. In any case, to augment the performance, effectiveness, and reliability of those projects, it is crucial to understand their behavior and resource consumption at the code runtime. Over the past decade, various tools are being developed and researched into the purpose of measuring complexity. But the predicted results could not be preserved by those methods, as the matrices used in the complexity calculation did not cover the basic principles of complexity measurements. By identifying and categorizing error points and key pressure points from previous investigations, new matrices were established that directly affected the complexity of the code. The code's complexity is determined by certain matrices occurring within the code. Besides, different weight values were also allocated at runtime according to their output complexity. The key features of the developed tool will be displayed in the informative table format according to the above-mentioned matrices, the complexity of the single program statement, and the total complexity of the selected program. It provides an instant summary of the scope of the programmed.
